title: Parity DApp Registry
---

The Parity UI uses an [underlying `DappReg` contract](https://github.com/paritytech/contracts/blob/master/DappReg.sol) to lookup and display dapps that have been registered on the network. Currently the contract does not have a DApp/UI yet, however it is available for both Homestead (mainnet), Ropsten, Kovan, and Morden (testnets):

* Homestead: [`0xD70994d7020DF8052A1124561ff548f3b88744d8`](https://etherscan.io/address/0xD70994d7020DF8052A1124561ff548f3b88744d8#code)
* Ropsten: [`0x724A8602fc0C2b346f8eC56Df2913710742d3fD0`](https://testnet.etherscan.io/address/0x724A8602fc0C2b346f8eC56Df2913710742d3fD0)
* Kovan: [`0xD36d48C274af1a169857C9721e122aa023A0eE01`](https://kovan.etherscan.io/address/0xD36d48C274af1a169857C9721e122aa023A0eE01)
* Morden: `0x11e869F9094a1101B4C60201d6Cf894AfC7EadBB`

You can find the ABI for this contract if you follow the link for the [Homestead contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xD70994d7020DF8052A1124561ff548f3b88744d8#code).

**WARNING** Only interact with the `DappReg` contract if you are certain you know what you are doing and understand the risks.

## Reserving a DApp

Execute the `register(_id: bytes32)` function on the `DappReg` contract with a unique id (once a DApp/UI is available this would probably be the sha3 of the name or a unique generated id) - the id could be as simple as the content hash for the initial dapp code (as generated by the [GitHub Hint DApp](Parity-Github-Hint))

Ensure that the required fee (currently 0.100 ETH) is paid and that the owner address is the address you wish to use to update associated metadata with.

Once registered, the id field in the manifest should (optionally) be updated to reflect this new `DappReg` id. Internally Parity will only use the `DappReg` id for applications retrieved via the network as to avoid conflicts and name clashes.

## Adding metadata

Set the metadata for the registered dapp with the `setMeta(_id: bytes32, _key: bytes32, _value: bytes32)` function on the contract. In each case -

- `_id` is the same id your reserved when registering the dapp above
- `_key` is the metadata key (more on this below)
- `_value` is the actual metadata value, which is a content hash as registered via the GitHub Hint DApp

Currently available metadata keys are the following -

- `content` - `0x434f4e54454e54` (`CONTENT`-hex-encoded), pointing to the dapp content bundle
- `manifest` - `0x4d414e4946455354` (`MANIFEST`-hex-encoded), pointing to the dapp `manifest.json`
- `image` - `0x494d47` (`IMG`-hex-encoded), pointing to the dapp logo
