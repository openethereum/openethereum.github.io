## Technical Overview
OpenEthereum's goal is to be the fastest, lightest, and most secure Ethereum client. We are developing OpenEthereum using the cutting-edge **Rust programming language**. OpenEthereum is licensed under the GPLv3 and can be used for all your Ethereum needs.

By default, OpenEthereum runs a JSON-RPC HTTP server on port `:8545` and a Web-Sockets server on port `:8546`. This is fully configurable and supports a number of APIs.
